Linear search algorithms
In computer science, linear search or sequential search is a method for finding 
an element within a list. 
It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found 
or the whole list has been searched

Space Complexity
The term Space Complexity is misused for Auxiliary Space at many places. 
Following are the correct definitions of Auxiliary Space and Space Complexity. 

Auxiliary Space
is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm.

The space Complexity of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm 
with respect to the input size. 
Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input
